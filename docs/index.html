              So this dude called Robert Nystrom wrote a book called
              <a href="https://craftinginterpreters.com/"
                >Crafting Interpreters</a
              >. You should totally get it. It's amazing.
            </p>
            <p>
              It walks you through every small piece of creating an interpreter
              for a small programming language called Lox. The first ~third of
              the book guides us through building a tree-walk interpreter in
              Java, called <code>jlox</code>. I followed along with it, but
              instead of Java, wrote the code in Rust. Thus the name:
              <code>jlox-rs</code>, because I have the creativity of a small
              handful of dried moths. Rust can be compiled to JavaScript, and
              after sprinkling a layer of web magic, you can now use this site
              to poke at my interpreter!
            </p>
            <h4>Challenges</h4>
            <p>
              The book sets a number of challenges. I've taken on all (?) of
              these, so the interpreter here has a few features not part of
              "standard" Lox:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                You get a nice, friendly error message (thanks to a thing called
                an "error production") if you use a binary operator with a
                missing left-hand-side value.
              </li>
              <li>
                You get a nice error message if you try to divide by zero.
              </li>
              <li>
                When you concatenate (with <code>+</code>) anything to a string,
                that thing gets cast to a string.
              </li>
              <li>
                Not depicted here: when run in REPL mode, the value of the last
                evaluated expression in an input is automatically printed.
              </li>
              <li>
                You get a nice, friendly error message when you try to access a
                declared, but uninitialized variable.
              </li>
              <li>
                <code>break</code> works inside loops as you'd expect (and
                errors out when used outside loops)
              </li>
              <li>
                Anonymous functions exist: you can
                <code>var f = fun() { return 3; }; print f();</code>
              </li>
              <li>
                You get a static analysis error if a local variable is not used
                (except in the REPL).
              </li>
              <li>
                Local variables are accessed in O(1) time by binding them in the
                variable resolution pass: each gets an index, and the variables
                are accessed in a <code>Vec</code> by index at runtime; instead
                of by name, in a (hash)map. By the way, this made everything
                after it way more complex :D
              </li>
              <li>
                Static methods exist. See the
                <code>advanced_classes</code> example.
              </li>
              <li>Getters also exist! And inheritance works with them!</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Rust things</h4>

            The differences between Java and Rust led to a few interesting
            results:

            <ul>
              <li>
                The Java implementation uses Java to generate Java code to DRY
                the AST. Naturally, I used Rust macros for this (and a few other
                conveniences).
              </li>
              <li>
                The Java implementation stores references to
                <code>Environment</code>s (basically, runtime variable scopes)
                in multiple places; most notably, closures are implemented by
                "just" storing another reference to the right environment. In
                Rust, the least painful way I could find was wrapping
                environments in <code>Rc&lt;RefCell&lt;_&gt;&gt;</code>.
              </li>
              <li>
                It's not just environments! All runtime values can appear in
                various positions where multiple references to them must exist
                at the same time; so basically EVERY runtime value / variable
                primarily exists as a
                <code>Rc&lt;RefCell&lt;_&gt;&gt;</code>.
              </li>
              <li>
                The <code>Result</code> type in Rust is awesome. I used it to
                handle all kinds of errors, and the
                <code>thiserror</code> library to raise specific error types.
                The book uses both booleans to store success states in some
                cases, and exceptions in some others; translating those took a
                little thinking (not too much).
              </li>
              <li>
                While I was at it, I added the location of the error to error
                messages. As the book hints, this is most optimally done by
                storing code locations as byte offsets most of the time, and
                only resolving them to line/column numbers when an error is
                printed to the user. (So that's what I did.)
              </li>
              <li>
                There are a few enums with lots of variants. Sometimes code
                needs / wants to operate on a specific variant. I didn't find a
                great solution to this: mostly the data of each variant is now a
                stand-alone struct, which works, but it feels a bit clumsy. It
                also gets a bit tangled up with all the
                <code>Rc&lt;RefCell&lt;_&gt;&gt;</code>.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Other things</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                I added tests for features I implemented as I went along; this
                really helped out during some hairy refactors.
              </li>
              <li>
                The Rust-to-WebAssembly pipeline is now fairly mature, I had
                very few problems setting it up.
              </li>
              <li>
                The code editor is Monaco-Editor, which is essentially the same
                thing that's used in VS Code. For syntax highlighting, I took
                one of the example Monaco language tokenizers, and tweaked it
                until it matched this Lox variant. So I guess you could say it's
                custom!
              </li>
              <li>
                There are a number of things in the implementation I'm not quite
                happy with, but this is good enough to stop, and move on to the
                next part of the book!
